///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

array_2.txt is the old array_wino.txt, not used anymore, can be deleted

array_wino.txt save the n_BG, n_signals and significance for the different wino masses
array_higgsino.txt save the n_BG, n_signals and significance for the different higgsino masses

GetXsec_simple.txt contains all the cross sections for wino and higgsino (given by Masahiko)
GetXsec_simple_higgsino.txt is an extract of GetXsec_simple it contains all the cross sections for higgsino (created to read easier)

Nr_Events_signal.txt contains the number of expected events for wino calculated using the cross sections
Nr_Events_signal_higgsino.txt contains the number of expected events for higgsino calculated using the cross sections
Nr_Events.txt contains the number of expected events for BG calculated using the cross sections (website)

efficiencies_complete.txt contains the efficiency for 2 cuts for the BG
cutevents.txt is the expected number of events for the BG after the 2 cuts

reco_track_e_signal_2.txt contains the reconstruction efficiency (wrong one !!!) for wino
reco_track_e_signal_higgsino.txt contains the reconstruction efficiency (wrong one !!!) for higgsino

kinematic_selection_higgsino_short_1e-05.txt contains the best kinematic selection for luminosity 30ab-1, fake rate 1e-5 for the higgsino with 0.7,1,1.5 TeV
kinematic_selection_higgsino_short_2e-07.txt contains the best kinematic selection for luminosity 30ab-1, fake rate 2e-7 for the higgsino with 0.7,1,1.5 TeV
kinematic_selection_higgsino_short_tot_1e-05.txt contains the best kinematic selection for luminosity 30ab-1, fake rate 1e-5 for the higgsino with all masses
kinematic_selection_higgsino_short_tot_2e-07.txt contains the best kinematic selection for luminosity 30ab-1, fake rate 1e-5 for the higgsino with all masses
kinematic_selection_wino_short_1e-05.txt contains the best kinematic selection for luminosity 30ab-1, fake rate 1e-5 for the wino with 1,2,3,4 TeV
kinematic_selection_wino_short_2e-07.txt contains the best kinematic selection for luminosity 30ab-1, fake rate 2e-7 for the wino with 1,2,3,4 TeV
kinematic_selection_wino_short_tot_1e-05.txt contains the best kinematic selection for luminosity 30ab-1, fake rate 1e-5 for the wino with all masses
kinematic_selection_wino_short_tot_2e-07.txt contains the best kinematic selection for luminosity 30ab-1, fake rate 1e-5 for the wino with all masses

kinematic_selection_wino_2e-07.txt try to calculate the best kinematic selection for each wino mass (there are some buggs in it !!) (abandoned)
